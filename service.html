                        The Klutch Method is a series of unique techniques used to command respect and
                        obedience from your dog. You become the alpha your dog has been waiting for.
                        We touch on this method in every class as it is our signature training 
                        that sets us apart from the rest of Seattle's Dog Training Businesses. This method
                        will work if you put in the time and effort. Let us show you how to take control!

                    We offer private training to anyone who wishes to have a more personalized approach
                    to their dogs training. This is for everyone, however we recommend this to folks with Dogs
                    who have behavioral issues. Because we require an evaluation for most of our classes, we
                    will let you know if you need to schedule a private session before enrolling your dog
                    in group classes.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The beauty of a private class, is that you get to customize what we do with your dog. 
                    You get to choose from the list of skills below. We will recommend skills and types of training,
                    but at the end of the day its your choice. Schedule an evaluation today, to get your dog
